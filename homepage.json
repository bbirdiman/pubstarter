		"we'll start with a textarea that allows collaborative writing and editing by the participants of the project, interested individuals who will be self-selected from the general population. the text will be light-markup that describes the building of the project. the project will consist of javascript code that takes the text in the textarea, and turns it into .html that will render it as an online web-mounted e-book. there will also be code that turns that .html into a .pdf. and code that turns it into an .epub. and code that turns it into a .mobi for amazon machines like the kindle. is it gonna save the textarea? is it gonna save this? it saved this, but it didn't save the textarea. i will have to fix that... it's now saving the textarea! &nbsp;yay!<br>",
